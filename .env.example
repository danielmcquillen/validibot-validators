# Validibot Validators — Environment Configuration
# =============================================================================
#
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values:
#   cp .env.example .env
#
# The justfile automatically loads .env when present.
#
# =============================================================================
# When do you need this?
# =============================================================================
#
# You only need these settings if you're PUSHING containers to a registry
# (e.g., for a cloud deployment on GCP Cloud Run, AWS ECS, etc.).
#
# If you're just building and running containers locally for development
# or self-hosted deployments, you don't need any of this — just use:
#   just build energyplus
#   just build-all
#
# =============================================================================
# Security considerations
# =============================================================================
#
# Validator containers execute user-supplied files (IDF models, FMUs, etc.)
# in an isolated environment. When deploying to production:
#
# 1. Use a PRIVATE container registry — validators are launched by the
#    Validibot platform with a specific image tag. A private registry
#    ensures only your tested images are used.
#
# 2. Use immutable image tags — tag images with the git SHA (the justfile
#    does this automatically) rather than relying on :latest. This ensures
#    deployments are reproducible and auditable.
#
# 3. Authenticate your registry — for GCP Artifact Registry:
#      gcloud auth configure-docker ${VALIDIBOT_GCP_REGION}-docker.pkg.dev
#
# 4. Restrict push access — only CI/CD pipelines or authorized developers
#    should be able to push new images. Pull access can be scoped to the
#    service account that runs Cloud Run Jobs.
#
# =============================================================================

# Required: Your GCP project ID (for Artifact Registry and Cloud Run)
VALIDIBOT_GCP_PROJECT=your-gcp-project-id

# Optional: GCP region (defaults to us-central1 if not set)
VALIDIBOT_GCP_REGION=us-central1
