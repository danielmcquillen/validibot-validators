GCS client utilities for validator containers.

DEPRECATED: This module is kept for backwards compatibility.
New code should import from validators.core.storage_client instead,
which supports both gs:// (GCS) and file:// (local filesystem) URIs.

All functions are re-exported from storage_client.py.
