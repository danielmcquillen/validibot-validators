## Licensing Context

This repository contains **advanced validator plugins** for [Validibot](https://validibot.com).
These advanced validators are licensed under the permissive **MIT License** to encourage
community contributions and make it easy to create, modify, and share validators.

### How This Fits With Validibot's Licensing

| Repository | License | Rationale |
|------------|---------|-----------|
| **validibot** (core) | AGPL-3.0 / Commercial | The core platform contains the orchestration, API, and business logic. AGPL ensures improvements to the platform are shared back, while commercial licenses are available for proprietary use. |
| **validibot-validators** (this repo) | MIT | Advanced validators are plugins that wrap third-party tools (EnergyPlus, FMI, etc.). MIT licensing reduces friction for contributors and users who want to write or modify validators. |

### What This Means For You

- **Using advanced validators**: You can use these advanced validators freely under MIT terms,
  but you still need to comply with the main Validibot license (AGPL or Commercial) when
  using the Validibot platform itself.

- **Contributing advanced validators**: Your contributions to this repo are MIT-licensed,
  making them easy to share and reuse.

- **Creating your own advanced validators**: You can fork, modify, or use these advanced
  validators as templates for your own under MIT terms.

### Third-Party Components

These advanced validators integrate with third-party tools that have their own licenses:

- **EnergyPlus**: BSD-3-Clause — U.S. Department of Energy / NREL ([license](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/blob/develop/LICENSE.txt))
- **FMPy**: BSD-3-Clause — Dassault Systèmes ([license](https://github.com/CATIA-Systems/FMPy/blob/main/LICENSE.txt))

You are responsible for complying with the licenses of any third-party tools these
validators interact with.

## Assumption of Risk

This software executes user-supplied files (building energy models, Functional
Mock-up Units, and other data) using third-party simulation tools inside Docker
containers. By using this software, you acknowledge and agree that:

- **You are solely responsible** for the security of your deployment, including
  container configuration, network isolation, access controls, and infrastructure.
- **You are solely responsible** for any files you submit for validation. The
  authors make no guarantee that container isolation will prevent all adverse
  effects from malicious or malformed input.
- **You are solely responsible** for any costs incurred through cloud
  infrastructure (compute, storage, network, etc.) when deploying this software.
- **You are solely responsible** for the handling, storage, and confidentiality
  of your data, including any files uploaded for validation.
- **Simulation and validation results are approximations only.** Results must be
  independently verified before use in any critical, safety-related, or
  regulatory application. The authors accept no liability for decisions made
  based on outputs from this software.

This section supplements — and does not limit — the warranty disclaimer and
limitation of liability in the MIT License above.
