## Licensing Context

This repository contains **advanced validator plugins** for [Validibot](https://validibot.com).
These advanced validators are licensed under the permissive **MIT License** to encourage
community contributions and make it easy to create, modify, and share validators.

### How This Fits With Validibot's Licensing

| Repository | License | Rationale |
|------------|---------|-----------|
| **validibot** (core) | AGPL-3.0 / Commercial | The core platform contains the orchestration, API, and business logic. AGPL ensures improvements to the platform are shared back, while commercial licenses are available for proprietary use. |
| **validibot-validators** (this repo) | MIT | Advanced validators are plugins that wrap third-party tools (EnergyPlus, FMI, etc.). MIT licensing reduces friction for contributors and users who want to write or modify validators. |

### What This Means For You

- **Using advanced validators**: You can use these advanced validators freely under MIT terms,
  but you still need to comply with the main Validibot license (AGPL or Commercial) when
  using the Validibot platform itself.

- **Contributing advanced validators**: Your contributions to this repo are MIT-licensed,
  making them easy to share and reuse.

- **Creating your own advanced validators**: You can fork, modify, or use these advanced
  validators as templates for your own under MIT terms.

### Third-Party Components

These advanced validators integrate with third-party tools that have their own licenses:

- **EnergyPlus**: BSD-3-Clause — U.S. Department of Energy / NREL ([license](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/blob/develop/LICENSE.txt))
- **FMPy**: BSD-3-Clause — Dassault Systèmes ([license](https://github.com/CATIA-Systems/FMPy/blob/main/LICENSE.txt))

You are responsible for complying with the licenses of any third-party tools these
validators interact with.
